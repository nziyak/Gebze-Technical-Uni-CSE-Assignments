this arduino project aimed a robot that wander and measures the forward distance to any surface and if the surface is closer than the indicated distance, 
robot stop going forward and turns around itself to the indicated side until the distance gets longer. at the same time, while distance is long green led
is on and red led is off,and the contrast is true. also a temperature sensor is attached on the robot and it measures and prints the temperature to a LCD 
screen continuously. this was a team project and we were two people in software side. One of was me and the other was Gülçin Hacıosmanoğlu. I wrote the sensor
pin initializations and entegrations parts. also the movement parts and the codes for the ultrasonic distance sensor and lm35 temperature sensor. also the if
statements of the leds according to the distance. this was kind of a rover. if the movements and other measurements are developed, the rover gets more effectivity.
